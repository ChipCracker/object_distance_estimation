This is the repository for the object_distance_estimation ros2 node.
It will be capable of estimating the distance of recognized objects via a cam and a 2d LiDAR.

# Starting the LiDAR node
ros2 run object_distance_estimation lidar_subscriber

# Starting the cam view node
ros2 run object_distance_estimation cam_visualisation
